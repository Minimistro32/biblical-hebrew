[How to Type Hebrew](https://chioulaoshi.org/BH/typing.html)

## Alphabet
Hebrew was originally written with just consonants. Some consonants change shape when appearing as the final consonant of a word. These are called `sofit`. Several sounds are repeated. The `dagesh` (dot) indicates [plosive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plosive) sounds. Every 'ch' is guttural as in Ba*ch*. Hebrew is read right to left.

> ||||Distinction|

> |Vet&emsp; ב|Kaf&emsp; כ||Vet is two strokes, which creates a tittle in the bottom right.|
> |Dalet&emsp; ד|Resh&emsp; ר||Dalet is two strokes, which creates a tittle in the top right.|

## Vowels
Vowels were pointed underneath the consonants after the fact by the Masoretes. The circles represent any consonant. Qamets and Qamets Hatuf are visually identical; however, Qamets Hatuf is rare. It is presumed that anciently long and short vowels were pronounced differently. This audible distinction can be ignored today, but knowing long and short vowels will be important for future grammar.
> 🧠: The dominant vowel within every name, except Qamets Hatuf, is the sound that vowel makes (e.g., p**A**tah, ts**E**re, hir**I**q, h**O**lem, qibb**U**ts). <br>
> 🧠: All the consonant vowels are long. 

|Short<br>(Name)|Long<br>(Name)|Sound|Transliteration|
|-|-|-|-|
|◌ַ<br>`Patah`|◌ָ<br>`Qamets`|ah|a|
|◌ֶ<br>`Segol`|◌ֵ<br>`Tsere`|eh|e|
|◌ִ<br>`Hiriq`|י◌ִ<br>`Hiriq Yod`|ee|i|
|◌ָ<br>`Qamets Hatuf`|◌ֹ / וֹ<br>`Holem (Vav)`|oh|o|
|◌ֻ<br>`Qibbuts`|וּ<br>`Shureq Vav`|oo|u|

## Noun/Adjective Endings
Nouns and adjectives agree in gender and number. Various endings express this agreement, including a set of `common` (agreeing for male and female) endings to represent two things. These `dual` agreements are commmonly used for things like body parts, of which there are two.

Nouns can be chained together using construct endings. The chain always ends with one absolute noun, and *constructs* a single idea. The final construction, or `construct chain`, indicates possession. The final, absolute noun, is used to determine if the entire phrase is indefinite or definite (uses a/an or the).

This following image demonstrate the difference between the construct and absolute forms of four masculine plural word examples. Stand-alone absolute forms are shown in the right column. Construct forms are demostrated on the left beginning each phrase.

![Construct Chain Example](https://hebrew4christians.com/Grammar/Unit_Four/The_Construct_Relation/mpconstructexamples1.gif)

Focus on the last example. The `maqqeph` (dash) has no pronounciation and simply connects related words. Notice how horse (סוס) changes from `iym` (abs., masc., pl.) to `eh` (cons., masc., pl.). Also note that translations can use apostrophe "s" or "of" without misrepresenting the Hebrew.

> 🧠: The feminine singular sound is 'ah', which is common to romance languages.<br>
> 🧠: In Hebrew, ה often changes to ת. <br>
> 🧠: The masculine plural sound is 'iym' as in Elohim, which you may find familiar. It can literally translate to gods, but is often used as a [plural of majesty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_we). <br>
> 🧠: The dual sound is 'ah' + 'iym' or 'ayim', and could be thought of as combining fem. and masc. into a complete couple.
