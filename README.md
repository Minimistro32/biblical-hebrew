## Alphabet
Hebrew was originally written with just consonants. Some consonants change shape when appearing as the final consonant of a word. These are called `sofit`. Several sounds are repeated. The `dagesh` (dot) indicates [plosive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plosive) sounds. Every 'ch' is guttural as in Ba*ch*. Hebrew is read right to left.

## Vowels
Vowels were pointed underneath the consonants after the fact by the Masoretes. The circles represent any consonant. Qamets and Qamets Hatuf are visually identical; however, Qamets Hatuf is rare. It is presumed that anciently long and short vowels were pronounced differently. This audible distinction can be ignored today, but knowing long and short vowels is important for future grammar.
> Mnemonic: The dominant sound within the name is the sound of the vowel. <br>
> Mnemonic: All the vowel consonants are long.

## Noun/Adjective Endings
Nouns and adjectives agree in gender and number. Various endings express this agreement, including a set of `common` (agreeing for male and female) endings to represent two things. These dual agreements are commmonly used for things like body parts, of which there are two.

Nouns can be chained together using construct endings. The chain always ends with one absolute noun, and *constructs* a single idea. The final construction, or `construct chain`, indicates possession. The final, absolute noun, is used to determine if the entire phrase is indefinite or definite (uses a/an or the).

This following image demonstrate the difference between the construct and absolute forms of four masculine plural word examples. Stand-alone absolute forms are shown in the right column. Construct forms are demostrated on the left beginning each phrase.

Focus on the last example. The `maqqeph` (dash) has no pronounciation and simply connects related words. Notice how horse (סוס) changes from `iym` (abs., masc., pl.) to `eh` (cons., masc., pl.). Also note that translations can use apostrophe "s" or "of" without misrepresenting the Hebrew.
