## Alphabet
Hebrew was originally written with just consonants. Some consonants [change appearance](https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/this-isnt-even-my-final-form.jpg) when written as the final consonant of a word. These are called `sofit`. Several sounds are repeated. The `dagesh` (dot) indicates [plosive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plosive) sounds. Every 'ch' is guttural as in Ba*ch*. Hebrew is read right to left.

## Vowels
Vowels were pointed underneath the consonants after the fact by the Masoretes. The circles represent any consonant. Qamets and Qamets Hatuf are visually identical; however, Qamets Hatuf is rare. It is presumed that anciently long and short vowels were pronounced differently. This audible distinction can be ignored today, but knowing long and short vowels will be important for future grammar.

|Short<br>(Name)|Long<br>(Name)|Sound|Transliteration|
|-|-|-|-|
|◌ַ<br>`Patah`|◌ָ<br>`Qamets`|ah|a|
|◌ֶ<br>`Segol`|◌ֵ<br>`Tsere`|eh|e|
|◌ִ<br>`Hiriq`|י◌ִ<br>`Hiriq Yod`|ee|i|
|◌ָ<br>`Qamets Hatuf`|◌ֹ / וֹ<br>`Holem (Vav)`|oh|o|
|◌ֻ<br>`Qibbuts`|וּ<br>`Shureq Vav`|oo|u|

> 🧠: The dominant vowel within every name, except the rare Qamets Hatuf, is the sound that vowel makes (e.g., p**A**tah, ts**E**re, hir**I**q, h**O**lem, qibb**U**ts). <br>
> 🧠: All the consonant vowels are long. 

## Noun and Adjective Endings
Nouns and adjectives agree in gender and number. Various endings express this agreement, including a set of `common` (agreeing for male and female) endings to represent two things. These `dual` agreements are commmonly used for things like body parts, of which there are two.

Nouns can be chained together using construct endings. The chain always ends with one absolute noun, and *constructs* a single idea. The final construction, or `construct chain`, indicates possession. The final, absolute noun, is used to determine if the entire phrase is indefinite or definite (uses a/an or the).

This following image demonstrate the difference between the construct and absolute forms of four masculine plural word examples. Stand-alone absolute forms are shown in the right column. Construct forms are demostrated on the left beginning each phrase.

![Construct Chain Example](https://hebrew4christians.com/Grammar/Unit_Four/The_Construct_Relation/mpconstructexamples1.gif)

Focus on the last example. The `maqqeph` (dash) has no pronounciation and simply connects related words. Notice how horse (סוס) changes from `iym` (abs., masc., pl.) to `eh` (cons., masc., pl.). Also note that translations can use apostrophe "s" or "of" without misrepresenting the Hebrew.

|**Singular**|◌ ◌ ◌|◌ ◌ ◌|ה◌ָ<sub><sup> ◌ ◌</sup></sub><br>`ah`|ת◌ַ<sub><sup> ◌ ◌</sup></sub><br>`at`|

|**Dual**|יִם◌ַ<sub><sup> ◌ ◌</sup></sub><br>`ayim`|י◌ֵ<sub><sup> ◌ ◌</sup></sub><br>`eh`|

> 🧠: The feminine singular sound is 'ah', which is common to romance languages.<br>
> 🧠: In Hebrew, ה often changes to ת. <br>
> 🧠: The masculine plural sound is 'iym' as in Elohim, which you may find familiar. It can literally translate to gods, but is often used as a [plural of majesty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_we). <br>
> 🧠: The dual sound is 'ah' + 'iym' or 'ayim', and could be thought of as combining fem. and masc. into a complete couple.

## Verb Conjugation and Aspect
All verbs in Hebrew have a `root` (or `lexical entry`) comprised of three consonants. *The primary task of Biblical Hebrew is determining which three consonants constitute the lexical entry* and looking up that entry in the lexicon. Verb conjugation in Hebrew expresses person, gender, number, and aspect. These conjugations must be parsed to identify the lexical entry.

### Aspect
A verb's [grammatical `aspect`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect) inflects the degree to which the action is completed and, in Hebrew, can be perfect or imperfect. Generally speaking, imperfect is used for incomplete action and perfect for complete action.

Conjugations in Biblical Hebrew do not inflect tense. Either aspect can be used in any tense. There are many ways to employ aspect in language; the following are just some English examples to illustrate the difference between _complete and incomplete_ action and shouldn't be taken prescriptively.

||Perfect|Imperfect|
|-|-|-|
|Past|I killed|I was killing|
|Present|I have killed|I kill|
|Future|I will have killed|I will kill|

### Conjugations
Some conjugations are `common` and only have one entry shown (e.g., the 1st person and 3rd person plural). Conjugations with multiple interpretations are color coordinated.

<!--
> 🧠: All imperfect conjugations have at least a prefix. "Imperfect aren't perfect, so they need a prefix."<br>
> 🧠: וּ ,נ, and ◌ֶ are always plural.<br>
> 🧠: נ is always at least feminine (could be common, see 1st person plural).<br>
> 🧠: First person is common.<br>
> 🧠: Perfect 3rd person singular is the same as the absolute singular noun endings.<br>
> 🧠: Tav is usually 2nd person.

> |Step #|Parsing Trick|

> |1) Aspect|Imperfect aren't perfect, so they need a prefix.|
> |2) Person|Lonely ת, is 2nd person <sup><sub>(or Fem. 3rd)</sub></sup>.|
> |3) Number|וּ ,נ, and ◌ֶ are plural.|
> |4) Gender|נ is feminine.|

> To get this working 100% of the time, memorize these additional 6 facts:
> - The person (usually first person) of the 5 `common` endings.
> - The gender of perfect 3rd person singular, which is identical to the [absolute singular noun endings](https://github.com/Minimistro32/biblical-hebrew/blob/main/README.md#chart).
