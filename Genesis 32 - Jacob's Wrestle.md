**Genesis 32:24; 26-28**

Translated by Tyson Freeze

24\) And Jacob is left over to his solitude. And a man wrestled with him until the rising of the dawn.

...

26\) And he said, “let me go because the dawn rises”. And he said, “I let you go not, except you bless me.”

27\) And he said to him, “What *is* your name?” And he said, “Jacob.”

28\) And he said to him, “Your name is no more said Jacob, but Yisrael because you strive with god and with man and you endure.”
