**Deuteronomy 5:1-13; 21; 24**

Translated by Tyson Freeze

\1) And Mosheh proclaimed to all Yisrael\. And he said to them, “Heed, Yisrael, the limits and decisions by arbitration that I am speaking in your ears today\. And learn them and keep watch to do them\.

\2) Jehovah, our God, cut a covenant with us in Horeb\.

\3) Jehovah cut this covenant, not with our fathers, but with us, ourselves, these here today, all of us living\.

\4) Face to face, Jehovah spoke with you in the mountain, out of the midst of the fire\.

\5) I was standing between Jehovah and you in that time he put forward to you the word of Jehovah\. You feared from before the fire and ascended not in the mountain\. *His* saying:

\6) I, Jehovah, *am* your god, which made you come out from the land of Egypt, out of a house of slaves\.

\7) You shall not have other gods over over my faces\.

\8) You shall not make yourselves an idol, of any form which *is* in the heavens above, or in the earth below, or in the waters under the earth\. 

\9) You shall not bow yourself to them, nor be enticed to serve them\. Indeed, I Jehovah, your god, am a jealous god, taking up the cause of fathers’ sin onto children and onto grandchildren and onto great-grandchildren, to them that hate me\.

\10) And producing faithful kindness for thousands to *be* my lovers and watch-keepers of my commandments\.

\11) You shall not raise the name of Jehovah, your god, to the worthless\. For Jehovah shall not leave unpunished, that *who* raises his name to the worthless\.

\12) To guard the day of the sabbath, to consecrate it like Jehovah, your god, commanded you\.

\13) Six days you serve and do all your work\.

...

\21) You shall not covet your fellow’s woman\. And you shall not crave your fellow’s house, his field, his male servant, his female servant, his ox, his donkey, or anything that *is* your fellow’s\.

...

\24) And you said, “Behold! Jehovah, our god, shows us his splendor and his greatness and his voice, we hear from the midst of the fire\. This day, truly, god speaks with man yet *he* lives\.
